   <h1>Indpendent Project Proposal</h1>
      
      <p> 
          <b> Project Name:</b> Blossom’s Cosplay Portfolio </p>
      <p><b>Project goal or purpose. What are we doing and why? Why now?</b> Creating a portfolio website for Blossom Dang’s cosplay. Portfolio would showcase her work, creating credibility in the cosplay community. </p> 
      <p><b>How will you know if this project is successful? What metrics will you track? </b>I would know if this project is successful by whether or not Blossom gets more commissions for her cosplay. Additionally, I might add Google Analytics to her site in order to add user data for it. </p>
      <p><b>What personas or audiences does this project help? Who else does it impact? </b>The personas that this project helps are primarily people in the cosplay community. It impacts Blossom, as well as her cosplay friends and acquaintances. </p>
      <p><b>List all the deliverables for your project then list the related activities you and those involved will do to complete those deliverables: The deliverables for this project would be: </b>
    <ul>
•	User personas
•	Wireframes 
•	Mockups 
•	User scenarios 
•	Website 
      </ul>
      
<p>I will get these deliverables by sitting down with and discussing the entire process with Blossom. I will consult her throughout the entire process, asking her opinions and input as we go along. </p>
      <p><b>Note any deliverables or activities that are not included in the scope: </b>Photographs, commission work, Blossom’s personal and professional information. Testimonials from friends or colleagues. 
      <p><b>What constraints are part of this project? What limits does the project have to happen under? </b>The biggest constraint to this project is time, as well as Blossom’s cooperation and approval. I would need to get all her data files for the site, as well as information for her portfolio.
